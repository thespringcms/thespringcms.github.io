## Why I make The Spring CMS

In Myanmar (Burms), after military coup, most of bank systems are down and many website owners from Myanmar are facing problem to pay for web hosting, and so, they need better free web hosting service. so I decided to create The Spring CMS. ***I'm not perfect, but I'll try my best.***
